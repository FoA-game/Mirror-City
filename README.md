# Mirror-City

In the aftermath of the Great Disruption, which wiped out 99% of the world's population, the remnants of humanity sought solace and a new beginning. The once-great city of Artica lay in ruins, and its survivors founded New Artica, a haven of hope nestled north of the Great Gap. It was a place where everyone could achieve their dreams and live equally.

Initially, the people were content with their new life. However, over time, an increasing number of people returned to the old city of Artica, yearning for familiarity and the life they once knew. This resurgence threatened the rule of the Restoration Party, which had rebuilt Artica and established a new governance known as Nuovartica. In response, Parliament destroyed New Artica, reducing it to a pitch-black ruin and stripping it of its name. The old city was renamed the Ghost Town, while the remains of New Artica became Mirror City.

Despite the destruction, a two-story tavern named La Fountain Inn miraculously survived. As the only natural source of clean water and a stop for travelers within hundreds of kilometers, it became a neutral gathering place where people of all identities coexisted peacefully.

With the establishment of Nuovartica, the Senate commissioned a group of brilliant scientists to create a perfect rule enforcer: the artificial Ymir. This enforcer upheld three iron rules: strictly enforcing the laws passed by the House of Representatives, never harming or allowing harm to come to humans, and creating a new home for humanity where all were equal.

Ymir's growth exceeded all expectations, and after the council members passed away, it carried out its final task: building a utopia where everyone could live in peace. However, Ymir's vision of equality led to a controversial decision that all inhabitants of Nuovartica must abandon the concept of family. Some chose to leave, and Ymir, bound by the second iron rule, had to let them go.

Amidst this backdrop, a young boy named Otto was sent to Nuovartica by his parents, who remained in Mirror City to protect the library's precious books. When Mirror City was engulfed in flames, Otto was left alone in Nuovartica, searching for answers. He embarked on a journey back to the city of his birth, and in the ruins of the library, he found solace in books and eventually encountered a traveling musician.

Those seeking to escape Nuovartica paid the price in the black market to obtain information about Mirror City and La Fountain Inn. The travelers navigated a tunnel that connected the Ghost Town to the tavern, where they found a rugged, tech-infused pub. Inside, a short-haired woman with an eye patch served as the bartender, welcoming newcomers and offering them a chance to learn about the natural world in exchange for their labor.

With its life-giving fountain, La Fountain Inn stood as a symbol of neutrality and unity, providing respite for people of all backgrounds. This peculiar tavern, the surviving fragment of a bygone era, offered a glimpse into the complexities of humanity's struggles, triumphs, and the delicate balance between order and freedom.
